# Data-Structures-With-C
In this repo, I'll try to talk about Data Structures
### Course Outlines
1. Stacks (array-based and linked based implementations).
2. Queues (array-based and linked based implementations).
3. General Lists (array-based and linked based implementations).
### 4. Search Algorithms in Lists.
   - Linear Search.
   - Binary Search.
   - Mathematical Analysis of Linear and Binary Search.
5. Binary Search Trees.
6. Introduction to Graphs.
7. Appendix: Introduction to Mathematical Analysis of Algorithms.
- This is a "Data Structures" course, not "Data Structures and Algorithms".
- Why "Analysis of Algorithms" in a "Data Structures" course?
- Why Data Structures in C and not in pseudo-code or any other language?

#### Why Data Structures
##### Stack Structure (LIFO) that's for Last in First out.

##### Queue Structure (FIFO) that's for First in First out.

##### Tree Structure.
- There are 3 nodes, each node can be a mathematical expression, so i need a structure to have these expressions then i can process them, It's called Treee structure.
- Data is operator or operand, each operand can be an expression.
- Tree structure is a special case from Graph structure.
- In this case it's binary tree.

##### Graph Structure
- It shows connectivity.
- think of it like u have N users, everyone of them could be connected with the rest of users (N-1)users.
- All these combinations in a structure called Graph structure.
