# Data-Structures-With-C
In this repo, I'll try to talk about Data Structures
### Course Outlines
1. Stacks (array-based and linked based implementations).
2. Queues (array-based and linked based implementations).
3. General Lists (array-based and linked based implementations).
### 4. Search Algorithms in Lists.
   - Linear Search.
   - Binary Search.
   - Mathematical Analysis of Linear and Binary Search.

5. Binary Search Trees.
6. Introduction to Graphs.
7. Appendix: Introduction to Mathematical Analysis of Algorithms.
• This is a "Data Structures" course, not "Data Structures and Algorithms".
• Why "Analysis of Algorithms" in a "Data Structures" course?
• Why Data Structures in C and not in pseudo-code or any other language?
